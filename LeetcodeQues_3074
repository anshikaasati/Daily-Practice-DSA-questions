//You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.

// There are n packs where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the ith box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.

// Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.

// Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: apple = [1,3,2], capacity = [4,3,1,5,2]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: We will use boxes with capacities 4 and 5.
// It is possible to distribute the apples as the total capacity is greater than or equal to the total number of apples.
// Example 2:

// Input: apple = [5,5,5], capacity = [2,4,2,7]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: We will need to use all the boxes.
